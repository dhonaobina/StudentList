# Creating Arrays
- A variable declared in JavaScript can store a single value, but what if you want to store multiple values in a single variable? Well, you may have to use an array.
In JavaScript, an array can store multiple values at a time. There are two types of arrays, single-dimensional and multi-dimensional.
##### In a single-dimensional array, you will have one row and multiple columns.
- You can identify each value stored in an array with the help of an index number.
- An index number within an array starts at 0. Therefore, the first element in an array is [0], the second element is [1], the third element is [2], and so on.
- You can traverse within an array with the help of loops.
##### In a multi-dimensional array, you will have multiple rows and multiple columns.
- A multi-dimensional array has multiple rows and columns. It is an array of arrays.
- You can consider a multi-dimensional array as a matrix where you can store data in rows and columns.
- You can display the multi-dimensional array data in a tabular format. In JavaScript, you need to use a nested for loop to work with multi-dimensional arrays.
